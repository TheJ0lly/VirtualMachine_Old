# VirtualMachine
A Virtual Machine written in C. It doesn't have a name as of now, but it will, hopefully.

As of now, the following instructions are available.
   - PUSH
   - MOVE
   - PEEK
   - RETURN
   - POP
   - HALT
   - PLUS
   - APPEND
   - APPEND_VAL
   - MINUS
   - DIV
   - MULT
   - LOAD
   - UNLOAD
   - CMP
   - CMP_VAL
   - JUMP
   - JEQ
   - JNE
You can read about these instructions in the include/vm.h.

## As of now
There is only the fibonacci program in the src/main.c file.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to build a fully functional Virtual Machine with its own language, and compiler/linker.
